during dev, there is a seeds file


for searching, need to run this
rake sunspot:solr:start

Indexes all existing songs
rake sunspot:reindexrake sunspot:

Need to change # songs in Selection model to 40 for implementation


to seed the song data, create a file db/songs.csv with the following format

name,artist,link,year
song title 1,artist 1,http://localhost/,2011

Run command   rake csv_model_import[db/songs.csv,Song]

Note: Watch out for comma's in the song and artist
I ended up replacing the commas with **, then taking them out with method Song.import_cleanup
